                <p className="font-italic text-muted mb-10 para about-para">
                  Like all fairytales, well this started with a few guys in
                  trouble. One was  was saddened by the badminton racquet left
                  behind, a second was dejected following another football
                  weekend that never materialised, a third was broke and
                  gym-less due to another membership getting lost, and a
                  fourth was simply #boredtodeath. Unfortunately, unlike
                  previous fairytales, no lovely damsel came to their aid, and
                  they wallowed in their misery for a time. In order to create
                  their own Neverland, a haven for other restless adrenaline
                  addicts like themselves, they eventually did what all
                  abandoned souls do. Sportify was therefore born as a concept
                  or, more accurately, a belief.

                <p className="font-italic text-muted mb-10 para about-para">
                  A dream to build a playground where you may blend in with
                  other outcasts and where entry is not restricted by thick
                  membership barriers. A conviction that you can play whenever,
                  whenever, and however you want without experiencing the misery
                  of waiting. A commitment to constructing a reality in which
                  one may both lose and find themselves, in which one can both
                  triumph and be defeated and laugh in both roles. A conviction
                  that playing the field is the ideal place to serve up
                  enjoyment.
